- What is a programming language?
Source code (JavaScript/Python/Java) -> Interpreter or Compiler -> machine language (bits / binary)

- Interpreter: goes line by line and translates each line and then executes it
- Compiler: takes the whole file and translates whole file in a binary file and then executes it


## Python Interpreter
- can download from:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

- default interpreter is cpython
- its written in C language
https://github.com/python/cpython
- download contains both Interpreter and VM
- Cpython interpreter generates bytecode -> then it uses Cpython VM to run this bytecode and execute it

- others: Jython(Java), PyPy(Python), IronPython(.NET)
